## 1. How interested are you in the topic of Big Data?
[On a scale from 1 to 10 where 1= Not at all interested & 10 = It's the topic I'm most interested in]
8

## 2. How excited are you for this class in comparison to your other courses? 
[On a scale from 1 to 10 where 1 = All my other classes are more interesting & 10 = This is the class I'm most looking forward to]
7

## 3. How comfortable do you feel working with raw data?
[On a scale from 1 to 10 where 1 = I'm terrified to deal with raw data & 10 = Throw any data set at me and I'm ready to do a full analysis]
6

## 4. What Big Data Tools have you used before?
[List tools separated by comma]
None

## 5. What other Big Data Tools have you heard of?
[List tools separated by commas]
Hadoop, MapR, GNIP


## 6. How confident are you making visualizations based on data?
[On a scale from 1 to 10 where 1 = I don't know how to visualize any kind of data & 10 = I can build beautiful visualizations for nearly any data set]
4 (I would very much so like to improve)

## 7. What programming languages are you most familiar with?
[List languages separated by commas]
Python, C++, CSS/HTML, Javascript, Scala, Haskell, 

## 8. What aspects of computer science do you hope to improve upon?
[Open-ended response]
I would really like to get better at making data beautiful. The big data aspects will be very interesting as well,
the more functional programming the better! 

## 9. What are your favorite computer science activities? (e.g., web design, data science, sysadmin, games, etc)
back end development, I like making things that people use and think are helpful... Machine learning is pretty fun,
the Lambda calculus as expressed by functional programming is inherently sexy.

## 10. To what extent are you self-motivated to create your own computer programs and applications?
[On a scale from 1 to 10 where 1 = I need someone telling me what to do every step of the way & 10 = Class or no class, I'm going to work hard to build things I love]
6 - another thing I work hard to improve


## 11. How interested in physical computing? (i.e., programming circuits and sensors)
[On a scale from 1 to 10 where 1 = Not interested at all & 10 = It's one of the things I'm most interested in]
8! The intersection between hardware and software has the most wonderful advances of the last few years

## 12. Rank the following data skills in order of how imporant you think they are to learn: collection, cleaning, analysis, visualization.
[Rank them 1 to 4; 1 = most important, 4 = least important]
4 2 3 1


## 13. Describe what you hope to gain from this class.
[Open-ended response] 

Described above, the ability to collect data and turn it into something beautiful would make this class
one of the more worthwhile ones I have taken.
