# Pre-Class Survey

## 1. How interested are you in the topic of Big Data?
7

## 2. How excited are you for this class in comparison to your other courses? 
9

## 3. How comfortable do you feel working with raw data?
5

## 4. What Big Data Tools have you used before?
SQL? I'm not sure what qualifies haha.

## 5. What other Big Data Tools have you heard of?
I'm brand new to the topic :)


## 6. How confident are you making visualizations based on data?
3

## 7. What programming languages are you most familiar with?
Javascript, Ruby, C, C++, Python, Haskell (in descending order of knowledge)

## 8. What aspects of computer science do you hope to improve upon?
I would love to be able to create beautiful and useful D3 visualizations. I also love the idea of collecting environmental data and analyzing it. To be honest, this class sounds incredible from what I've heard. I'm ready to learn and iterate on anything it has to offer!

## 9. What are your favorite computer science activities? (e.g., web design, data science, sysadmin, games, etc)
I'm very interested in web design and development, front end frameworks, working with local startups, beautiful UI's, and mobile apps. Of course I'm always interested in learning about new topics as well.

## 10. To what extent are you self-motivated to create your own computer programs and applications?
8


## 11. How interested in physical computing? (i.e., programming circuits and sensors)
6

## 12. Rank the following data skills in order of how imporant you think they are to learn: collection, cleaning, analysis, visualization.
1. visualization
2. analysis
3. collection
4. cleaning


## 13. Describe what you hope to gain from this class.
Even though question 12 asks us to rank the data skills from most to least important, I truly believe it's the 'T-shaped' type of knowledge that will lead to a successful life. What this means (for those who don't know), is that you want a very broad range of topics and skills you know about and have a general understanding of, with some possible experience with them (the horizontal line of the "T"). Then you want one thing you are extremely passionate about and good at (vertical line of the "T"). I hope that I can develop a good 'T-shaped' discipline from this course and all that it has to offer. I'm very excited to see what it has to offer, and how much I can push myself to learn more.
