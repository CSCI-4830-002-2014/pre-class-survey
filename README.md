For each question, supply an answer as specified by the text in [].  When you respond, please erase this text as well as the brackets and put your answer in its place.

## 1. How interested are you in the topic of Big Data?
[On a scale from 1 to 10 where 1= Not at all interested & 10 = It's the topic I'm most interested in]
8

## 2. How excited are you for this class in comparison to your other courses? 
[On a scale from 1 to 10 where 1 = All my other classes are more interesting & 10 = This is the class I'm most looking forward to]
8. This class has some really cool real life applications, but it's not the class I'm most looking forward to (Robotics).
9. 
## 3. How comfortable do you feel working with raw data?
[On a scale from 1 to 10 where 1 = I'm terrified to deal with raw data & 10 = Throw any data set at me and I'm ready to do a full analysis]
9

## 4. What Big Data Tools have you used before?
[List tools separated by comma]
None

## 5. What other Big Data Tools have you heard of?
[List tools separated by commas]
None


## 6. How confident are you making visualizations based on data?
[On a scale from 1 to 10 where 1 = I don't know how to visualize any kind of data & 10 = I can build beautiful visualizations for nearly any data set]
8

## 7. What programming languages are you most familiar with?
[List languages separated by commas]
Java, C, C++, Prolog, Ruby, Python, Scala in that order

## 8. What aspects of computer science do you hope to improve upon?
[Open-ended response]
I hope to become better at writing cleaner code and simplifying complex ideas in my head. My code can sometimes tend towards the opposite.

## 9. What are your favorite computer science activities? (e.g., web design, data science, sysadmin, games, etc)
Android development

## 10. To what extent are you self-motivated to create your own computer programs and applications?
[On a scale from 1 to 10 where 1 = I need someone telling me what to do every step of the way & 10 = Class or no class, I'm going to work hard to build things I love]
7


## 11. How interested in physical computing? (i.e., programming circuits and sensors)
[On a scale from 1 to 10 where 1 = Not interested at all & 10 = It's one of the things I'm most interested in]
9

## 12. Rank the following data skills in order of how imporant you think they are to learn: collection, cleaning, analysis, visualization.
[Rank them 1 to 4; 1 = most important, 4 = least important]
1: Analyis, 2: Collection, 3: Cleaning, 4: Visualization

## 13. Describe what you hope to gain from this class.
[Open-ended response] 
Methods I can use to become a better programmer and perhaps create some application which will utilize the concepts of big data presented in this course. I just hope the skills I learn are truly applicable to real world commputer sciene.
